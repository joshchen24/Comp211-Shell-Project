 Simple Shell (Tar Heel SHell - thsh)
Welcome to thsh, a simple custom shell implemented in C as a hands-on project to explore low-level operating system concepts like process creation, environment variables, and command execution.

This shell supports basic built-in commands, like cd and exit, and can execute external system commands like pwd and ls. It is designed to demonstrate how minimal shell interfaces work under the hood.

Features
Built-in command support: cd, exit

Execution of external programs (ls, pwd, etc.)

Uses system calls: fork, exec, and wait

Resolves executables using $PATH via getenv

Command parsing with heap-allocated argv

Basic memory safety and cleanup (Valgrind tested)

Concepts Demonstrated
Process Control: Creating, executing, and managing processes via fork(), exec(), and wait().

Environment Interaction: Accessing environment variables with getenv().

Command Resolution: Searching for executables using system $PATH.

Memory Management: Dynamically allocating command arguments and freeing them properly.

Error Handling: Handling invalid input and failures in command execution.
